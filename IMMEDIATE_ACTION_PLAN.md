## âš¡ **IMMEDIATE ACTION 1: Real-Time Stock Data Implementation** (Start Now)

### Why This First?
Your `StocksPage.tsx` currently uses mock data. This is the **highest business impact** change you can make immediately:
- âœ… Requirements are documented (PRD-2025-06-29-real-time-stock-data.md)
- âœ… User story is defined (US-003-real-time-stock-data.md)  
- âœ… Development branch is ready (`feature/real-time-stock-data`)
- âœ… Framework process is being followed

### Step 1: Set Up Market Data API (30 minutes)

Create API integration for real market data:

```typescript
// Create: src/shared/types/market-data.ts
interface MarketDataResponse {
  symbol: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  change: number;
  change_percent: number;
  volume: number;
  market_cap: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  market: 'US' | 'SA';
}

interface MarketStatus {
  market: 'US' | 'SA';
  is_open: boolean;
  next_open: Date;
  next_close: Date;
}
```

### Step 2: Create Real API Endpoint (45 minutes)

Replace mock data with real API integration:
