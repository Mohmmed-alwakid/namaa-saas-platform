#### 💼 Portfolio Management APIs
- `GET /api/portfolios` - Retrieve all portfolios with performance metrics
- `POST /api/portfolios` - Create new investment portfolios

#### 📈 Stock Market APIs  
- `GET /api/stocks/price/:symbol` - Real-time stock price data
- `POST /api/stocks/prices` - Bulk stock price retrieval
- Support for both US (`market=US`) and Saudi (`market=SAU`) markets

### 🎨 Frontend Infrastructure
- **React 19** with TypeScript for modern development
- **Vite** for fast development and hot module replacement
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, professional styling
- **Component architecture** ready for rapid development

## 🛡️ Development Best Practices

### Always Use Smart Development:
```bash
# Recommended workflow
npm run dev:smart           # Starts everything intelligently
```

### For API Testing:
```bash
# Backend only for API development
node backend-only-dev.cjs
```

### For Frontend Development:
```bash
# After backend is running
npm run dev:client
```

### For Interactive Development:
```bash
# User-friendly development interface
npm run dev:toolkit         # Windows
./dev-toolkit.sh           # Linux/Mac (when created)
```
