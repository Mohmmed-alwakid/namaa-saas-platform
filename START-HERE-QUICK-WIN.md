- Markets: US stocks (NYSE, NASDAQ) and Saudi stocks (Tadawul)  
- Users: Retail investors and institutional investors
- Current Status: Basic portfolio tracking exists, need intelligent alerting

REQUIRED PRD SECTIONS:
1. Executive Summary (business value, user impact, success criteria)
2. Functional Requirements (specific capabilities, user interactions)
3. Non-Functional Requirements (performance <2sec, 99.9% reliability, real-time updates)
4. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin format: Given/When/Then scenarios)
5. Technical Implementation (React components, Supabase real-time subscriptions, notification APIs)
6. Risk Assessment (technical risks, business risks, mitigation strategies)
7. Success Metrics (user engagement, notification accuracy, performance KPIs)
8. Implementation Timeline (Phase 1: basic alerts, Phase 2: advanced filters, Phase 3: AI-powered insights)

OUTPUT FORMAT: Professional PRD ready for stakeholder approval, with clear sections and actionable details.
```

### Step 3: Review & Save (5 minutes)
1. **Review the generated PRD** - check for completeness
2. **Save as**: `requirements/PRD-2025-06-29-portfolio-alerts.md`
3. **Time comparison**: 15 minutes vs. 2+ hours manual work

**Expected Result**: Complete, professional PRD ready for team review
