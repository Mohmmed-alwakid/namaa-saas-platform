## 🎯 QA Philosophy

### Quality Standards
- **Zero Critical Bugs**: No critical issues in production
- **User-Centric**: Every feature tested from user perspective
- **Performance First**: All features must meet performance benchmarks
- **Security by Design**: Security testing integrated into all phases

### Testing Pyramid
```
E2E Tests (10%)     ▲ High-level user journeys
Integration (30%)   ■ API and service integration  
Unit Tests (60%)    ▬ Individual component testing
```
