## 🎯 Smart Process Orchestration

### **AI-Powered Requirement Generation**

#### Intelligent PRD Assistant
```typescript
// Smart PRD Generator
interface SmartPRDRequest {
  feature: string;
  userType: 'retail' | 'institutional' | 'admin';
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
  marketFocus: 'US' | 'Saudi' | 'both';
}

class IntelligentPRDGenerator {
  generatePRD(request: SmartPRDRequest): PRDDocument {
    return {
      acceptanceCriteria: this.generateAcceptanceCriteria(request),
      technicalRequirements: this.generateTechSpecs(request),
      testScenarios: this.generateTestCases(request),
      riskAssessment: this.assessRisks(request),
      effortEstimate: this.estimateEffort(request)
    };
  }
}
```

#### Smart User Story Templates
```gherkin
# Auto-generated based on feature type
Feature: {{feature_name}}
  As a {{user_type}}
  I want {{capability}}
  So that {{business_value}}

Scenario: {{primary_scenario}}
  Given {{precondition}}
  When {{action}}
  Then {{expected_outcome}}
  And {{success_criteria}}
```
