## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Portfolio Performance Alerts
  As an investor using Namaa Investment Platform
  I want to receive real-time notifications when my investments change significantly
  So that I can make timely decisions and never miss important market movements

Scenario: Setting up basic price alerts
  Given I am logged into Namaa platform
  And I have stocks in my portfolio
  When I navigate to Alert Settings
  And I enable "5% daily change alerts" for my entire portfolio
  And I select "In-app + Email" as notification methods
  Then I should see confirmation "Alerts configured successfully"
  And my alert preferences should be saved and active

Scenario: Receiving significant price drop alert
  Given I have alerts configured for 5% changes
  And I own 100 shares of AAPL at $180/share
  When AAPL drops to $170/share (5.56% decline)
  Then I should receive an in-app notification within 2 seconds
  And I should receive an email within 30 seconds
  And the alert should show "AAPL down 5.56% (-$10.00) affecting your $18,000 position"

Scenario: Managing alert frequency during volatile periods
  Given AAPL is experiencing high volatility
  And I received an alert 10 minutes ago for 5% drop
  When AAPL drops another 2% (now 7% total)
  Then I should NOT receive another alert due to 15-minute cooldown
  But when 15 minutes pass and AAPL drops to 10% total
  Then I should receive an escalated "urgent" alert

Scenario: Portfolio-wide sector alert
  Given I own technology stocks representing 40% of my portfolio
  When the technology sector drops 3% in one day
  Then I should receive a grouped alert saying "Technology sector down 3% affecting 4 of your holdings"
  And the alert should show total dollar impact on my portfolio

Scenario: Customizing quiet hours
  Given I set quiet hours from 10 PM to 7 AM EST
  When a 5% price movement occurs at 2 AM EST
  Then I should NOT receive immediate notifications
  But I should see a summary alert when quiet hours end at 7 AM
  And urgent alerts (>10%) should override quiet hours
```
