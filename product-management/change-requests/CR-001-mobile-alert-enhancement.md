## 🎯 Detailed Requirements

### Mobile-Specific Enhancements
1. **Gesture-Based Threshold Selection**
   - Replace sliders with swipe-to-adjust threshold controls
   - Implement haptic feedback for threshold milestones
   - Add pinch-to-zoom for precise percentage selection

2. **Simplified Mobile Workflow**
   - Multi-step wizard instead of single-page form
   - Progress indicator showing completion status
   - Skip/preset options for quick setup

3. **Touch-Optimized Components**
   - Larger touch targets (minimum 44px)
   - Bottom sheet modals for selection lists
   - Pull-to-refresh for alert status updates

### Technical Specifications
- Native iOS/Android gesture recognition
- Responsive breakpoints: <768px mobile-first design
- Touch event handling with 300ms debounce
- Offline capability for alert configuration

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Gesture Controls
- **Given** I am on mobile alert configuration
- **When** I swipe left/right on threshold selector
- **Then** threshold values should adjust smoothly with haptic feedback

### AC2: Wizard Workflow
- **Given** I am setting up my first alert on mobile
- **When** I complete each step of the wizard
- **Then** I should see clear progress and be able to navigate back/forward

### AC3: Touch Optimization
- **Given** I am using the mobile interface
- **When** I interact with any control element
- **Then** all touch targets should be minimum 44px and respond immediately
